PICMI



General Information
-------------------

Picmi has the following dependencies:

At compile time:
sfml2, qt, boost, cmake

At run time:
sfml2, qt, boost-thread


The default installation directories are

$prefix/share/picmi        (gfx)
$prefix/bin                (executable)
$prefix/share/applications (.desktop file)
~/.config/picmi/	(user configurations and highscores, created at runtime)

$prefix can be configured by setting the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable when running cmake and defaults to /usr/local/ if not set.

Manual Installation (easier but less customizable)
-------------------

Check above for archlinux and ubuntu installation packages.

In the picmi directory containing CMakeLists.txt, execute:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" .
make
make install

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can be set as required.
This will install to the default directories as specified above. For packaging,

make DESTDIR="/your/packaging/dir" install

will install to /your/packaging/dir.

All done, execute picmi to run the game.



Enjoy!
