PICMI



General Information
-------------------

Picmi has the following dependencies:

At compile time:
sfml, qt, boost

At run time:
sfml, qt, boost-thread


The default installation directories are

/usr/share/picmi        (gfx)
/usr/bin                (executable)
/usr/share/applications (.desktop file)
~/.config/picmi/	(user configurations and highscores, created at runtime)


Installation from AUR (Archlinux)
-------------------

Install using your favorite AUR helper or manually with wget && makepkg && pacman -U.

Manual Installation (easier but less customizable)
-------------------

CAUTION: manual installation is NOT point and click!
Check above for archlinux and ubuntu installation packages.

In the picmi directory containing picmi.pro, execute:

qmake
make setpath
make
sudo make install

This will install to the default directories as specified above. For packaging,

make INSTALL_ROOT=/your/packaging/dir install

will install to /your/packaging/dir (but the application will still be configured
to run from default directories). This method is used in the Archlinux PKGBUILD (see above).



Manual Installation (harder)
-------------------

CAUTION: manual installation is NOT point and click!
Check above for archlinux and ubuntu installation packages.


The first step is to decide where to install picmi.
These instructions will assume you are using the default directories.


Point picmi to the directory containing the graphics:

1. edit src/b_painter.h and set the desired FILEPREFIX. For installation to /usr/share/picmi, the result will look as follows:

#define FILEPREFIX "/usr/share/picmi/"


To compile, enter the project directory and run

1. qmake
2. make


Installation to /usr/share/picmi:

mkdir -p /usr/{bin,share/{applications,picmi/gfx}}
install -D -m755 picmi /usr/bin/
install -D -m644 src/picmi.desktop /usr/share/applications/
install -D -m644 gfx/* /usr/share/picmi/gfx/


All done, execute picmi to run the game.



Enjoy!
