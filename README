This project was originally started by Tobias Hellgren ( see http://www.thanius.com/picross/ ). 
Currently it is being developed by Jakob Gruber ( jakob@gruber.kabelnet@at )

Currently, I'm planning on 
 * click on a column/row header to mark/unmark entire row.
 * implementing puzzle parsing from icon image files. We need to go through a specified folder 
   and analyze each file, discard unsuitable files, find a threshhold for all files and convert 
   them to 2-color bitmaps. Store the original files to display when the puzzle finishes.
 * once this is working we will need a menu system and some polish.
 * timer
 * high scores
 * getting new gfx

Implemented:
 * getting this into a playable state
 * implementing mouse control (this should be easy). 
   Left click to mark, right click to unmark.

I'm also thinking of doing a rewrite if this implementation turns out to be too 
limiting ( fixed puzzle sizes, puzzles must be squared, etc. )
