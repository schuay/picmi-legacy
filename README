TUX PICROSS


Project Information
-------------------

This project was originally started by Tobias Hellgren ( see http://www.thanius.com/picross/ ). 
Currently it is being developed by Jakob Gruber ( jakob.gruber@kabelnet.at )

Picross is a number logic game in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left 
blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. 

For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross .

So far, the core gameplay has been implemented. Puzzles are randomly generated for now.


Some of the things I'm planning on implementing
-------------------

* Puzzle loading / generation from png image files

We should be able to take any png file (of suitable size and content), analyze it and generate a picross board from it.

* Usability Tweaks
 * right clicking on a row/column header marks all clear tiles
 * right mouse button drag should only perform a single operation: either clear->marked or marked-> clear

* Appearance Tweaks / Polish
 * Animations, nicer font, nicer sprites and background
 
* GUI Loader

The loader is responsible for displaying things like high scores, available puzzles / puzzlesets,
changing settings, and launching tuxpicross with the appropriate arguments.
Wishlist: an online DB with puzzle ratings from all users - puzzles can be loaded from here.


Usage (for up to date instructions, run 'tuxpicross -h')
-------------------

mouse controls:
    left click: expose a tile
    right click: mark/unmark a tile

keyboard controls:
    arrow keys: move
    ctrl: expose a tile
    shift: mark/unmark a tile

arguments:
    -x num: x dimension of generated puzzle (defaults to 15)
    -y num: y dimension of generated puzzle (defaults to 15)
    -n: enable no hints mode. incorrect tile marks are not prevented (default is disabled)
    -r num: generate random puzzle with percentage num of board filled 
            for example, 'tuxpicross -r 60' will generate a random board with 60% of all tiles filled
            (defaults to 55)    -s: generate static puzzle (for debug purposes)
    -h: show this message
