PICMI


Project Information
-------------------

Picmi was inspired by Tux Picross which was originally started in 2004
by Tobias Hellgren ( see http://www.thanius.com/picross/ ).

Picmi includes

* a picross clone ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross )
* and a minesweeper clone ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(computer_game) )

Currently it is being developed by Jakob Gruber.

Picross is a number logic game in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left 
blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. 

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game. The object of the game is to clear an
abstract minefield without detonating a mine.


Features
-------------------

* basic picross gameplay
* no hints mode: do not automatically prevent incorrect tile hits - the player must solve the 
  puzzle correctly without hints. there is no penalty time in this mode.
* randomly generated puzzles with arbitraty size and difficulty
* display which streaks are solved by greying out numbers
* drag locking: during a drag, movement is locked either to the row or 
  column to prevent undesired movement
* drag operation locking: during a right mouse button drag, either all 
  affected tiles are cleared OR marked, not both

* basic minesweeper gameplay
* guaranteed solvable boards (logic only, no guessing)

* statistics / highscore tracking
