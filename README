PICMI


Project Information
-------------------

Picmi was inspired by Tux Picross which was originally started in 2004
by Tobias Hellgren ( see http://www.thanius.com/picross/ ).

Picmi includes

* a picross clone ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross )
* and a minesweeper clone ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(computer_game) )

Currently it is being developed by Jakob Gruber.

Picross is a number logic game in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left 
blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. 

Minesweeper is a single-player video game. The object of the game is to clear an
abstract minefield  without detonating a mine.

* drag locking: during a drag, movement is locked either to the row or
